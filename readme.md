If you will apply for the role. I will need you to do a test once I deliver the details for you to prove that you were able to bypass Cloudflare.

## Objective:-
Be able to login, do a search query for a string i.e. "paymob", scrap the results (threads, replies,members..etc) and save them into json files.
whenever there's a result. it should scrap(thread title, thread owner, thread date, how many replies, the body of the thread, the replies with their owner's data, and a snippet where the string mentioned "whether it post or reply.")

Create the sample.json and send it to me to evaluate.
